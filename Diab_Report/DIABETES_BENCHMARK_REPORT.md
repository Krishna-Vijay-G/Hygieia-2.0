## 3. Probability Distribution Analysis

### 3.1 Prediction Confidence

**Correct Predictions (79 cases):**
- Mean Probability: 32.3%
- Standard Deviation: 31.7%
- Interpretation: Wide confidence range suggests model uncertainty even on correct predictions

**Incorrect Predictions (21 cases):**
- Mean Probability: 48.9%
- Standard Deviation: 25.6%
- Interpretation: Higher mean probability indicates borderline cases causing errors

### 3.2 Confidence Analysis

The model shows relatively low confidence scores overall, suggesting:
1. Conservative probability estimates
2. Potential calibration opportunities
3. Natural uncertainty in borderline cases

**Recommendation:** Consider probability calibration (Platt scaling or isotonic regression) to improve confidence scores.

---

## 4. Risk Stratification

The model categorizes patients into three risk levels based on predicted diabetes probability:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Low Risk (<30%):       54 patients (54.0%)    │
│  Medium Risk (30-70%):  24 patients (24.0%)    │
│  High Risk (>70%):      22 patients (22.0%)    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Risk Distribution Chart:**
```
Low Risk    ████████████████████████████ 54%
Medium Risk ████████████ 24%
High Risk   ███████████ 22%
```

**Clinical Workflow Recommendations:**

| Risk Level | Count | Recommended Action |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| 🟢 **Low Risk** | 54 (54%) | Standard care, annual screening |
| 🟡 **Medium Risk** | 24 (24%) | Enhanced monitoring, lifestyle intervention |

## 7. Error Analysis

### 7.1 False Negative Analysis (12 cases)

**Critical Clinical Issue:** Patients with diabetes not detected by model

**Potential Causes:**
- Borderline glucose levels
- Early-stage diabetes with subtle indicators
- Feature engineering not capturing interaction patterns
- Model bias toward majority class (no diabetes)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Lower decision threshold to increase sensitivity
2. Implement confidence-based flagging for manual review
3. Additional feature engineering for subtle diabetes markers
4. Consider cost-sensitive learning to penalize false negatives

### 7.2 False Positive Analysis (9 cases)

**Lower Priority Issue:** Healthy patients flagged for additional testing

**Impact:** Additional costs for confirmatory testing but safer than missing cases

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of pre-diabetes
- Opportunity for lifestyle intervention
- Better safe than sorry approach
